# Hello-World
This repository will contain my attempts at programming after approximately 15 years away from actual code writing.
My name is David Treptor and I have been involved with computers in some way since 1972.  I went to work for the US Army at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in the Combat Developments Command Maintenance Agency.  I was initially brought on as a Key Punch Operator through a work study program with my high school.  While there I learned about COBOL and FORTRAN programming.  I left to enlist in the US Navy, where sadly, I did not pursue the computer field.  I did, however, take college courses in COBOL, FORTRAN and several other languages.  Once I got out of the Navy, I went to work for several companies as a Technical Writer, writing correspondence courses for the US Army.  This gradually led to me returning to the computer field where I worked in some variety for the next 35 years.  I retired from the State of Delaware as a Senior Application Support Specialist.  I would like to get back into coding.
